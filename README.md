# nomplus

Nomplus is an extension to nom 5.

It provides some parsers and combinators that I find useful in parsing languages, such as:

* sp! and sp1! for adding whitespace around a parser
* sequence! and wsequence! for replacing the deprecated do_parse
* cut_with to transform an error into a specific failure
